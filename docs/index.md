# Welcome to Sun Lab at Whitehead Institute!

The Sun Lab seeks to harness vast single-cell transcriptomic and spatial data to develop and apply cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models. Our goal is to deepen the understanding of fundamental principles of functional cell-cell communication within and between organs, such as brain-immune system crosstalk, and its crucial roles in integrating genotype and phenotype. By extending these insights to a wide range of biological contexts and applications, our work aims to accelerate the discovery of novel intercellular and inter-organ therapies, opening new avenues for therapeutic innovation in human diseases.
