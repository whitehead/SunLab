# Welcome to the Sun Laboratory

## Advancing Molecular and Computational Biology

The Sun Laboratory, established in 2024, combines cutting-edge experimental approaches with computational methods to understand fundamental biological processes. Our interdisciplinary team works at the intersection of epigenetics, genome engineering, and systems biology.

## Research Highlights

### Latest Discovery: Epigenetic Signatures in Cancer Progression

Our team recently identified a novel set of epigenetic markers that accurately predict treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer. This groundbreaking work, published in Nature Genetics, opens new avenues for personalized medicine approaches.
